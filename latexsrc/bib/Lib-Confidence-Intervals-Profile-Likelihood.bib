		The method of constructing confidence regions based on the generalised likelihood ratio statistic is well known for parameter vectors. 
		A similar construction of a confidence interval for a single entry of a vector can be implemented by repeatedly maximising over the other parameters. 
		We present an algorithm for finding these confidence interval endpoints that requires less computation. 
		It employs a modified Newton-Raphson iteration to solve a system of equations that defines the endpoints.
