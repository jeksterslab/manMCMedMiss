		Despite wide applications of both mediation models and missing data techniques, formal discussion of mediation analysis with missing data is still rare. 
		We introduce and compare four approaches to dealing with missing data in mediation analysis including listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, multiple imputation (MI), and a two-stage maximum likelihood (TS-ML) method. 
		An R package bmem is developed to implement the four methods for mediation analysis with missing data in the structural equation modeling framework, and two real examples are used to illustrate the application of the four methods. 
		The four methods are evaluated and compared under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing data mechanisms through simulation studies. 
		Both MI and TS-ML perform well for MCAR and MAR data regardless of the inclusion of auxiliary variables and for AV-MNAR data with auxiliary variables. 
		Although listwise deletion and pairwise deletion have low power and large parameter estimation bias in many studied conditions, they may provide useful information for exploring missing mechanisms.

		This article proposes a new procedure to test mediation with the presence of missing data by combining nonparametric bootstrapping with multiple imputation (MI). 
		This procedure performs MI first and then bootstrapping for each imputed data set. 
		The proposed procedure is more computationally efficient than the procedure that performs bootstrapping first and then MI for each bootstrap sample. 
		The validity of the procedure is evaluated using a simulation study under different sample size, missing data mechanism, missing data proportion, and shape of distribution conditions. 
		The result suggests that the proposed procedure performs comparably to the procedure that combines bootstrapping with full information maximum likelihood under most conditions. 
		However, caution needs to be taken when using this procedure to handle missing not-at-random or nonnormal data.

		A method using multiple imputation and bootstrap for dealing with missing data in mediation analysis is introduced and implemented in both SAS and R. Through simulation studies, it is shown that the method performs well for both MCAR and MAR data without and with auxiliary variables. It is also shown that the method can work for MNAR data if auxiliary variables related to missingness are included. The application of the method is demonstrated through the analysis of a subset of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Mediation analysis with missing data can be conducted using the provided SAS macros and R package bmem.
