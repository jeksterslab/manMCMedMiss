		This is the first book to demonstrate the application of power analysis to the newer more advanced statistical techniques that are increasingly used in the social and behavioral sciences. 
		Both basic and advanced designs are covered. Readers are shown how to apply power analysis to techniques such as hierarchical linear modeling, 
		meta-analysis, 
		and structural equation modeling. 
		Each chapter opens with a review of the statistical procedure and then proceeds to derive the power functions. 
		This is followed by examples that demonstrate how to produce power tables and charts. 
		The book clearly shows how to calculate power by providing open code for every design and procedure in R,
		SAS, 
		and SPSS. 
		Readers can verify the power computation using the computer programs on the book's website. 
		There is a growing requirement to include power analysis to justify sample sizes in grant proposals. 
		Most chapters are self-standing and can be read in any order without much disruption.
		This book will help readers do just that. 
		Sample computer code in R, 
		SPSS, 
		and SAS at www.routledge.com/9781848729810 are written to tabulate power values and produce power curves that can be included in a grant proposal.
				
		Organized according to various techniques, chapters 1 â€“ 3 introduce the basics of statistical power and sample size issues including the historical origin, 
		hypothesis testing, 
		and the use of statistical power in t tests and confidence intervals. 
		Chapters 4 - 6 cover common statistical procedures -- analysis of variance, 
		linear regression (both simple regression and multiple regression), 
		correlation, 
		analysis of covariance, 
		and multivariate analysis. 
		Chapters 7 - 11 review the new statistical procedures -- multi-level models, 
		meta-analysis, 
		structural equation models, 
		and longitudinal studies. 
		The appendixes contain a tutorial about R and show the statistical theory of power analysis.
				
		Intended as a supplement for graduate courses on quantitative methods, 
		multivariate statistics, 
		hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and/or multilevel modeling and SEM taught in psychology, 
		education, 
		human development, 
		nursing, 
		and social and life sciences, 
		this is the first text on statistical power for advanced procedures. 
		Researchers and practitioners in these fields also appreciate the book's unique coverage of the use of statistical power analysis to determine sample size in planning a study. 
		A prerequisite of basic through multivariate statistics is assumed.

		Noted for its accessible approach, 
		this text applies the latest approaches of power analysis to both null hypothesis and minimum-effect testing using the same basic unified model. 
		Through the use of a few simple procedures and examples,
		the authors show readers with little expertise in statistical analysis how to obtain the values needed to carry out the power analysis for their research.
		Illustrations of how these analyses work and how they can be used to choose the appropriate criterion for defining statistically significant outcomes are sprinkled throughout.
		The book presents a simple and general model for statistical power analysis based on the F statistic and reviews how to determine:
		the sample size needed to achieve desired levels of power; 
		the level of power needed in a study; 
		the size of effect that can be reliably detected by a study; 
		and sensible criteria for statistical significance. 
		The book helps readers design studies, 
		diagnose existing studies, 
		and understand why hypothesis tests come out out the way they do.
				
		The fourth edition features:
				
		\begin{itemize}
			\item New Boxed Material sections provide examples of power analysis in action and discuss unique issues that arise as a result of applying power analyses in different designs.
			\item Many more worked examples help readers apply the concepts presented.
			\item Expanded coverage of power analysis for multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) to show readers how to analyze up to four factors with repeated measures on any or all of the factors.
			\item Re-designed and expanded web based One Stop F Calculator software and data sets that allow users to perform all of the book's analyses and conduct significance tests, power analyses, and assessments of N and alpha needed for traditional and minimum-effects tests.
			\item Easy to apply formulas for approximating the number of subjects required to reach adequate levels of power in a wide range of studies.
		\end{itemize}
				
		Intended as a supplement for graduate/advanced undergraduate courses in research methods or experimental design, 
		intermediate, 
		advanced, 
		or multivariate statistics, 
		statistics II, 
		or psychometrics, 
		taught in psychology, 
		education, 
		business, 
		and other social and health sciences,
		researchers also appreciate the book's applied approach.

		This book addresses sample size and power in the context of research, 
		offering valuable insights for graduate and doctoral students as well as researchers in any discipline where data is generated to investigate research questions. 
		It explains how to enhance the authenticity of research by estimating the sample size and reporting the power of the tests used. 
		Further, 
		it discusses the issue of sample size determination in survey studies as well as in hypothesis testing experiments so that readers can grasp the concept of statistical errors, 
		minimum detectable difference, 
		effect size, 
		one-tail and two-tail tests and the power of the test. 
		The book also highlights the importance of fixing these boundary conditions in enhancing the authenticity of research findings and improving the chances of research papers being accepted by respected journals. 
				
		Further, 
		it explores the significance of sample size by showing the power achieved in selected doctoral studies. 
		Procedure has been discussed to fix power in the hypothesis testing experiment. 
		One should usually have power at least 0.8 in the study because having power less than this will have the issue of practical significance of findings. 
		If the power in any study is less than 0.5 then it would be better to test the hypothesis by tossing a coin instead of organizing the experiment. 
		It also discusses determining sample size and power using the freeware G*Power software, 
		based on twenty-one examples using different analyses, 
		like t-test, parametric and non-parametric correlations,
		multivariate regression,
		logistic regression,
		independent and repeated measures ANOVA, 
		mixed design, MANOVA and chi-square.
