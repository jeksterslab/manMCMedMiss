		The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. 
		The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. 
		mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. 
		This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. 
		In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. 
		mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs.
		Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. 
		Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. 
		mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. 
		This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.

		The Rocker Project provides widely used Docker images for R across different application scenarios. 
		This article surveys downstream projects that build upon the Rocker Project images and presents the current state of R packages for managing Docker images and controlling containers. 
		These use cases cover diverse topics such as package development, 
		reproducible research, 
		collaborative work, 
		cloud-based data processing, 
		and production deployment of services. 
		The variety of applications demonstrates the power of the Rocker Project specifically and containerisation in general. 
		Across the diverse ways to use containers, we identified common themes: 
		reproducible environments, 
		scalability and efficiency, 
		and portability across clouds. 
		We conclude that the current growth and diversification of use cases is likely to continue its positive impact, 
		but see the need for consolidating the Rockerverse ecosystem of packages, 
		developing common practices for applications, and exploring alternative containerisation software.
