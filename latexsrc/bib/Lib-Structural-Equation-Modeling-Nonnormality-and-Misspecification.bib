		In covariance structure modeling,
		several estimation methods are available.
		The robustness of an estimator against specific violations of assumptions can be determined empirically by means of a Monte Carlo study.
		Many such studies in covariance structure analysis have been published,
		but the conclusions frequently seem to contradict each other.
		An overview of robustness studies in covariance structure analysis is given,
		and an attempt is made to generalize findings.
		Robustness studies are described and distinguished from each other systematically by means of certain characteristics.
		These characteristics serve as explanatory variables in a meta-analysis concerning the behavior of parameter estimators,
		standard error estimators,
		and goodness-of-fit statistics when the model is correctly specified.

		A family of scaling corrections aimed to improve the chi-square approximation of goodness-of-fit test statistics in small samples,
		large models,
		and nonnormal data was proposed in Satorra and Bentler (1994).
		For structural equations models,
		Satorra-Bentler's (SB) scaling corrections are available in standard computer software.
		Often,
		however,
		the interest is not on the overall fit of a model,
		but on a test of the restrictions that a null model say $M_{0}$ implies on a less restricted one $M_{1}$.
		If $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$ denote the goodness-of-fit test statistics associated to $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$,
		respectively,
		then typically the difference $T_{d} = T_{0} - T_{1}$ is used as a chi-square test statistic with degrees of freedom equal to the difference on the number of independent parameters estimated under the models $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$.
		As in the case of the goodness-of-fit test,
		it is of interest to scale the statistic $T_{d}$ in order to improve its chi-square approximation in realistic,
		that is,
		nonasymptotic and nonormal,
		applications.
		In a recent paper,
		Satorra (2000) shows that the difference between two SB scaled test statistics for overall model fit does not yield the correct SB scaled difference test statistic.
		Satorra developed an expression that permits scaling the difference test statistic,
		but his formula has some practical limitations,
		since it requires heavy computations that are not available in standard computer software.
		The purpose of the present paper is to provide an easy way to compute the scaled difference chi-square statistic from the scaled goodness-of-fit test statistics of models $M_{0}$ and $M_{1}$.
		A Monte Carlo study is provided to illustrate the performance of the competing statistics.

		Robust corrections to standard errors and test statistics have wide applications in structural equation modeling (SEM). 
		The original SEM development, due to Satorra and Bentler (1988, 1994), was to account for the effect of nonnormality. 
		Muth\'{e}n (1993) proposed corrections to accompany certain categorical data estimators, such as cat-LS or cat-DWLS.
		Other applications of robust corrections exist.
		Despite the diversity of applications, all robust corrections are constructed using the same underlying rationale:
		They correct for inefficiency of the chosen estimator.
		The goal of this article is to make the formulas behind all types of robust corrections more intuitive.
		This is accomplished by building an analogy with similar equations in linear regression and then by reformulating the SEM model as a nonlinear regression model.

		This article provides an overview of different computational options for inference following normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in structural equation modeling (SEM) with incomplete normal and nonnormal data.
		Complete data are covered as a special case.
		These computational options include whether the information matrix is observed or expected,
		whether the observed information matrix is estimated numerically or using an analytic asymptotic approximation,
		and whether the information matrix and the outer product matrix of the score vector are evaluated at the saturated or at the structured estimates.
		A variety of different standard errors and robust test statistics become possible by varying these options.
		We review the asymptotic properties of these computational variations, and we show how to obtain them using lavaan in R.
		We hope that this article will encourage methodologists to study the impact of the available computational options on the performance of standard errors and test statistics in SEM.

		In real data analysis with structural equation modeling,
		data are unlikely to be exactly normally distributed.
		If we ignore the non-normality reality,
		the parameter estimates,
		standard error estimates,
		and model fit statistics from normal theory based methods such as maximum likelihood (ML) and normal theory based generalized least squares estimation (GLS) are unreliable.
		On the other hand,
		the asymptotically distribution free (ADF) estimator does not rely on any distribution assumption but cannot demonstrate its efficiency advantage with small and modest sample sizes.
		The methods which adopt misspecified loss functions including ridge GLS (RGLS) can provide better estimates and inferences than the normal theory based methods and the ADF estimator in some cases.
		We propose a distributionally weighted least squares (DLS) estimator,
		and expect that it can perform better than the existing generalized least squares,
		because it combines normal theory based and ADF based generalized least squares estimation.
		Computer simulation results suggest that model-implied covariance based DLS (DLSM) provided relatively accurate and efficient estimates in terms of RMSE.
		In addition,
		the empirical standard errors,
		the relative biases of standard error estimates,
		and the Type I error rates of the Jiang-Yuan rank adjusted model fit test statistic (TJY) in DLSM were competitive with the classical methods including ML, GLS, and RGLS.
		The performance of DLSM depends on its tuning parameter a.
		We illustrate how to implement DLSM and select the optimal a by a bootstrap procedure in a real data example.
