		Aims
						 
		A mediator is a variable that explains the underlying mechanism between an independent variable and a dependent variable.
		The indirect effect indicates the effect from the predictor to the outcome variable via the mediator.
		In contrast,
		the direct effect represents the predictor's effort on the outcome variable after controlling for the mediator.
						 
		Methods
						 
		A single study rarely provides enough evidence to answer research questions in a particular domain.
		Replications are generally recommended as the gold standard to conduct scientific research.
		When a sufficient number of studies have been conducted addressing similar research questions,
		a meta-analysis can be used to synthesize those studies' findings.
						 
		Results
						 
		The main objective of this paper is to introduce two frameworks to integrating studies using mediation analysis.
		The first framework involves calculating standardized indirect effects and direct effects and conducting a multivariate meta-analysis on those effect sizes.
		The second one uses meta-analytic structural equation modeling to synthesize correlation matrices and fit mediation models on the average correlation matrix.
		We illustrate these procedures on a real dataset using the R statistical platform.
						 
		Conclusion
						 
		This paper closes with some further directions for future studies.
