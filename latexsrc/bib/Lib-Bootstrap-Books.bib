		The jackknife and the bootstrap are nonparametric methods
		for assessing the errors in a statistical estimation problem.
		They provide several advantages over the traditional parametric approach:
		the methods are easy to describe
		and they apply to arbitrarily complicated situations;
		distribution assumptions,
		such as normality,
		are never made.
														
		This monograph connects the jackknife,
		the bootstrap,
		and many other related ideas such as cross-validation,
		random subsampling,
		and balanced repeated replications into a unified exposition.
		The theoretical development is at an easy mathematical level
		and is supplemented by a large number of numerical examples.
														
		The methods described in this monograph form a useful set of tools
		for the applied statistician.
		They are particularly useful in problem areas
		where complicated data structures are common,
		for example,
		in censoring,
		missing data,
		and highly multivariate situations.

		This monograph addresses two quite different topics, in the belief that each can shed light on the other.
		Firstly, it lays the foundation for a particular view of the bootstrap.
		Secondly, it gives an account of Edgeworth expansion.
		Chapter 1 is about the bootstrap, witih almost no mention of Edgeworth expansion;
		Chapter 2 is about Edgeworth expansion, with scarcely a word about the bootstrap;
		and Chapters 3 and 4 bring these two themes together, using Edgeworth expansion to explore and develop the properites of the bootstrap.
		The book is aimed a a graduate level audience who has some exposure to the methods of theoretical statistics.
		However, technical details are delayed until the last chapter (entitled ``Details of Mathematical Rigour''), and so a mathematically able reader without knowledge of the rigorous theory of probability will have no trouble understanding the first four-fifths of the book.
		The book simultaneously fills two gaps in the literature; it provides a very readable graduate level account of the theory of Edgeworth expansion, and it gives a detailed introduction to the theory of bootstrap methods.

		The jackknife and bootstrap are the most popular data-resampling methods used in statistical analysis.
		The resampling methods replace theoretical derivations required in applying traditional methods (such as substitution and linearization) in statistical analysis by repeatedly resampling the original data and making inferences from the resamples.
		Because of the availability of inexpensive and fast computing, these computer-intensive methods have caught on very rapidly in recent years and are particularly appreciated by applied statisticians.
		The primary aims of this book are (1) to provide a systematic introduction to the theory of the jackknife, the bootstrap, and other resampling methods developed in the last twenty years;
		(2) to provide a guide for applied statisticians: practitioners often use (or misuse) the resampling methods in situations where no theoretical confirmation has been made;
		and (3) to stimulate the use of the jackknife and bootstrap and further developments of the resampling methods.
		The theoretical properties of the jackknife and bootstrap methods are studied in this book in an asymptotic framework.
		Theorems are illustrated by examples.
		Finite sample properties of the jackknife and bootstrap are mostly investigated by examples and/or empirical simulation studies.
		In addition to the theory for the jackknife and bootstrap methods in problems with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, we try to cover, as much as we can, the applications of the jackknife and bootstrap in various complicated non-i.i.d. data problems.

		Bootstrap methods are computer-intensive methods of statistical analysis,
		which use simulation to calculate standard errors,
		confidence intervals,
		and significance tests.
		The methods apply for any level of modelling,
		and so can be used for fully parametric,
		semiparametric, and
		completely nonparametric analysis.
		This 1997 book gives a broad and up-to-date coverage of bootstrap methods,
		with numerous applied examples,
		developed in a coherent way with the necessary theoretical basis.
		Applications include stratified data;
		finite populations;
		censored and missing data;
		linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models;
		classification;
		time series and spatial problems.
		Special features of the book include:
		extensive discussion of significance tests and confidence intervals;
		material on various diagnostic methods;
		and methods for efficient computation,
		including improved Monte Carlo simulation.
		Each chapter includes both practical and theoretical exercises.
		S-Plus programs for implementing the methods described in the text
		are available from the supporting website.

		This text will equip both practitioners and theorists with the necessary background in testing hypothesis and decision theory to enable innumerable practical applications of statistics.
		Its intuitive and informal style makes it suitable as a text for both students and researchers.
		It can serve as the basis a one- or two-semester graduate course as well as a standard handbook of statistical procedures for the practitioners' desk.
										
		Parametric, permutation, and bootstrap procedures for testing hypotheses are developed side by side.
		The emphasis on distribution-free permutation procedures will enable workers in applied fields to use the most powerful statistic for their applications and satisfy regulatory agency demands for methods that yield exact significance levels, not approximations.
		Algebra and an understanding of discrete probability will take the reader through all but the appendix, which utilizes probability measures in its proofs.
										
		The revised and expanded text of the 3rd edition includes many more real-world illustrations from biology, business, clinical trials, economics, geology, law, medicine, social science and engineering along with twice the number of exercises.
		Real-world problems of missing and censored data, multiple comparisons, nonresponders, after-the-fact covariates, and outliers are dealt with at length.
		New sections are added on sequential analysis and multivariate analysis plus a chapter on the exact analysis of multi-factor designs based on the recently developed theory of synchronous permutations.
										
		The book's main features include:
										
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Detailed consideration of one-,
			      two-,
			      and k-sample tests,
			      contingency tables,
			      clinical trials,
			      cluster analysis,
			      multiple comparisons,
			      multivariate analysis,
			      and repeated measures
			\item Numerous practical applications in archeology,
			      biology,
			      business,
			      climatology,
			      clinical trials,
			      economics,
			      education,
			      engineering,
			      geology,
			      law,
			      medicine,
			      and the social sciences
			\item Valuable techniques for reducing computation time
			\item Practical advice on experimental design
			\item Sections on sequential analysis
			\item Comparisons among competing bootstrap,
			      parametric,
			      and permutation techniques.

		Bootstrap methods provide a powerful approach to statistical data analysis,
		as they have more general applications than standard parametric methods.
		An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R
		explores the practicality of this approach and successfully utilizes \texttt{R} to illustrate applications
		for the bootstrap and other resampling methods.
		This book provides a modern introduction to bootstrap methods
		for readers who do not have an extensive background in advanced mathematics.
		Emphasis throughout is on the use of bootstrap methods as an exploratory tool,
		including its value in variable selection and other modeling environments.
														
		The authors begin with a description of bootstrap methods and its relationship to other resampling methods,
		along with an overview of the wide variety of applications of the approach.
		Subsequent chapters offer coverage of improved confidence set estimation,
		estimation of error rates in discriminant analysis,
		and applications to a wide variety of hypothesis testing and estimation problems,
		including pharmaceutical, genomics, and economics.
		To inform readers on the limitations of the method,
		the book also exhibits counterexamples to the consistency of bootstrap methods.
														
		An introduction to \texttt{R} programming provides the needed preparation to work
		with the numerous exercises and applications presented throughout the book.
		A related website houses the book's \texttt{R} subroutines,
		and an extensive listing of references provides resources for further study.
														
		Discussing the topic at a remarkably practical and accessible level,
		An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to \texttt{R} is an excellent book
		for introductory courses on bootstrap and resampling methods at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.
		It also serves as an insightful reference for practitioners working with data in engineering,
		medicine,
		and the social sciences who would like to acquire a basic understanding of bootstrap methods.
