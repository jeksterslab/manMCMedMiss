		Let $x$ and $y$ follow a normal bivariate probability function with means $\bar X, \bar Y$, standard deviations $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$, respectively, $r$ the coefficient of correlation, and $\rho_1 = \bar X/\sigma_1, \rho_2 = \bar Y/\sigma_2$. Professor C. C. Craig [1] has found the probability function of $z = xy/\sigma_1\sigma_2$ in closed form as the difference of two integrals. For purposes of numerical computation he has expanded this result in an infinite series involving powers of $z, \rho_1, \rho_2$, and Bessel functions of a certain type; in addition, he has determined the moments, semin-variants, and the moment generating function of $z$. However, for $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ large, as Craig points out, the series expansion converges very slowly. Even for $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ as small as 2, the expansion is unwieldy. We shall show that as $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2 \rightarrow \infty$, the probability function of $z$ approaches a normal curve and in case $r = 0$ the Type III function and the Gram-Charlier Type A series are excellent approximations to the $z$ distribution in the proper region. Numerical integration provides a substitute for the infinite series wherever the exact values of the probability function of $z$ are needed. Some extensions of the main theorem are given in section 5 and a practical problem involving the probability function of $z$ is solved.

		A simple exact formula for the variance of the product of two random variables, say, x and y, is given as a function of the means and central product-moments of x and y. The usual approximate variance formula for xy is compared with this exact formula; e.g., we note, in the special case where x and y are independent, that the ``variance'' computed by the approximate formula is less than the exact variance, and that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the sum of the reciprocals of the squared coefficients of variation of x and y. The case where x and y need not be independent is also studied, and exact variance formulas are presented for several different ``product estimates.'' (The usefulness of exact formulas becomes apparent when the variances of these estimates are compared.) When x and y are independent, simple unbiased estimates of these exact variances are suggested; in the more general case, consistent estimates are presented.

		This article discusses total indirect effects in linear structural equation models.
		First,
		I define these effects.
		Second,
		I show how the delta method may be used to obtain the standard errors of the sample estimates of these effects and test hypotheses about the magnitudes of the indirect effects.
		To keep matters simple,
		I focus throughout on a particularly simple linear structural equation system;
		for a treatment of the general case,
		see Sobel (1986).
		To illustrate the ideas and results,
		a detailed example is presented.
