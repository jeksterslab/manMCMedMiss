		The underlying theory upon which a great number of statistical procedures are based assumes that the variable or variables sampled are normally distributed.
		While there has been a good deal of theoretical research on the robustness of these procedures,
		the results seem not to have been set out in terms which the unsophisticated user of statistical methods can easily assimilate.
		The present paper, based on extensive computer simulation, aims at relating diagrammatically the shape of population to the robustness of the distribution of four simple statistics.
		A set of 29 Johnson SB and SU curves, several Pearson and Weibull curves and some large-sample histograms have been used as populations. The results indicate the extent to which the population moment ratios $\sqrt{\beta 1}$ and $\sqrt{\beta 2}$ determine the degree of robustness; charts are provided which should help the user, if he has some knowledge of these two parameters, to decide whether the lack of robustness matters from the practical aspect with which he is concerned.

		Glass, Peckham, and Sanders discourage the use of nonparametric counterparts of the $t$-test even when it is known that data were sampled from non-normal (e.g., highly skewed) distributions.
		This paper contends that Glass et al. erred in taking this position and that their error was due,
		at least in part,
		to their failure to consider the relative power of the $t$-test and its nonparametric counterparts under various population shapes.
		It is further contended that Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test has power properties that make it preferable to the $t$-test in many, perhaps even most,
		non-normal population situations.

		L-shaped distributions are not rare and are probably far more prevalent than is generally realized.
		They are highly conducive to nonrobustness of normality-assuming statistical tests, and they strongly resist transformation to normality.
		The thinner the tail of the distribution, the more unlikely it is that its L-shapedness will be detected by inspecting a sample drawn from it.
		Yet, as the tail of an L-shaped distribution becomes increasingly shallow, its skewness and kurtosis depart increasingly from their ``normal-distribution'' values, and the distribution becomes increasingly conducive to drastic nonrobustness.
		Worse, a fairly common type of experimental situation in psychological research produces shallow-tailed L-shaped distributions.

		An investigation of the distributional characteristics of 440 large-sample achievement and psychometric measures found all to be significantly nonnormal at the alpha .01 significance level.
		Several classes of contamination were found,

		exponential-level asymmetry,
		severe digit preferences,
		multimodalities,
		and modes external to the mean/median interval.
		Thus,
		the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data.

		findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions.
		A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.

		The Type I and II error properties of the t test were evaluated by means of a Monte Carlo study that sampled 8 real distribution shapes identified by T. Micceri (1986, 1989) as being representative of types encountered in psychology and education research.
		Results showed the independent-samples t tests to be reasonably robust to Type I error when (1) sample sizes are equal, (2) sample sizes are fairly large, and (3) tests are 2-tailed rather than 1-tailed. 
		Nonrobust results were obtained primarily under distributions with extreme skew.
		The t test was robust to Type II error under these nonnormal distributions,
		but researchers should not overlook robust nonparametric competitors that are often more powerful than the t test when its underlying assumptions are violated.

		Parametric statistics are based on the assumption of normality.
		Recent findings suggest that Type I error and power can be adversely affected when data are non-normal.
		This paper aims to assess the distributional shape of real data by examining the values of the third and fourth central moments as a measurement of skewness and kurtosis in small samples.
		The analysis concerned 693 distributions with a sample size ranging from 10 to 30.
		Measures of cognitive ability and of other psychological variables were included.
		The results showed that skewness ranged between -2.49 and 2.33.
		The values of kurtosis ranged between -1.92 and 7.41.
		Considering skewness and kurtosis together the results indicated that only 5.5\% of distributions were close to expected values under normality.
		Although extreme contamination does not seem to be very frequent,
		the findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that normality is not the rule with real data.

		Statistical analysis is crucial for research and the choice of analytical technique should take into account the specific distribution of data.
		Although the data obtained from health,
		educational,
		and social sciences research are often not normally distributed,
		there are very few studies detailing which distributions are most likely to represent data in these disciplines.
		The aim of this systematic review was to determine the frequency of appearance of the most common non-normal distributions in the health, 
		educational,
		and social sciences.
		The search was carried out in the Web of Science database,
		from which we retrieved the abstracts of papers published between 2010 and 2015.
		The selection was made on the basis of the title and the abstract,
		and was performed independently by two reviewers.
		The inter-rater reliability for article selection was high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.84),
		and agreement regarding the type of distribution reached 96.5\%.
		A total of 262 abstracts were included in the final review.
		The distribution of the response variable was reported in 231 of these abstracts,
		while in the remaining 31 it was merely stated that the distribution was non-normal.
		In terms of their frequency of appearance,
		the most-common non-normal distributions can be ranked in descending order as follows:
		gamma,
		negative binomial,
		multinomial,
		binomial,
		lognormal,
		and exponential.
		In addition to identifying the distributions most commonly used in empirical studies these results will help researchers to decide which distributions should be included in simulation studies examining statistical procedures.
