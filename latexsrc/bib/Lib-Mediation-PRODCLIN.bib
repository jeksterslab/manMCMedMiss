		The most commonly used method to test an indirect effect is to divide the estimate of the indirect effect by its standard error and compare the resulting $z$ statistic with a critical value from the standard normal distribution.
		Confidence limits for the indirect effect are also typically based on critical values from the standard normal distribution.
		This article uses a simulation study to demonstrate that confidence limits are imbalanced because the distribution of the indirect effect is normal only in special cases.
		Two alternatives for improving the performance of confidence limits for the indirect effect are evaluated:
		(a) a method based on the distribution of the product of two normal random variables,
		and (b) resampling methods.
		In Study 1,
		confidence limits based on the distribution of the product are more accurate than methods based on an assumed normal distribution but confidence limits are still imbalanced.
		Study 2 demonstrates that more accurate confidence limits are obtained using resampling methods,
		with the bias-corrected bootstrap the best method overall.

		This article describes a program, PRODCLIN (distribution of the PRODuct Confidence Limits for INdirect effects), written for SAS, SPSS, and R, that computes confidence limits for the product of two normal random variables. 
		The program is important because it can be used to obtain more accurate confidence limits for the indirect effect, as demonstrated in several recent articles (MacKinnon, Lockwood, \& Williams, 2004; Pituch, Whittaker, \& Stapleton, 2005). 
		Tests of the significance of and confidence limits for indirect effects based on the distribution of the product method have more accurate Type I error rates and more power than other, more commonly used tests. 
		Values for the two paths involved in the indirect effect and their standard errors are entered in the PRODCLIN program, and distribution of the product confidence limits are computed. 
		Several examples are used to illustrate the PRODCLIN program.
