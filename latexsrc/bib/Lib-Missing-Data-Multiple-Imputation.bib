		Demonstrates how nonresponse in sample surveys and censuses can be handled by replacing each missing value with two or more multiple imputations. 
		Clearly illustrates the advantages of modern computing to such handle surveys, and demonstrates the benefit of this statistical technique for researchers who must analyze them. 
		Also presents the background for Bayesian and frequentist theory. 
		After establishing that only standard complete-data methods are needed to analyze a multiply-imputed set, the text evaluates procedures in general circumstances, outlining specific procedures for creating imputations in both the ignorable and nonignorable cases. 
		Examples and exercises reinforce ideas, and the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas presents a unified picture of modern statistics.

		We present a procedure for computing significance levels from data sets whose missing values have been multiply imputed data. 
		This procedure uses moment-based statistics, $m \leq 3$ repeated imputations, and an F reference distribution. 
		When $m = \infty$, we show first that our procedure is essentially the same as the ideal procedure in cases of practical importance and, second, that its deviations from the ideal are basically a function of the coefficient of variation of the canonical ratios of complete to observed information. 
		For small $m$ our procedure's performance is largely governed by this coefficient of variation and the mean of these ratios. 
		Using simulation techniques with small $m$, we compare our procedure's actual and nominal large-sample significance levels and conclude that it is essentially calibrated and thus represents a definite improvement over previously available procedures. 
		Furthermore, we compare the large-sample power of the procedure as a function of $m$ and other factors, such as the dimensionality of the estimand and fraction of missing information, to provide guidance on the choice of the number of imputations; generally, we find the loss of power due to small $m$ to be quite modest in cases likely to occur in practice.

		Conducting sample surveys, imputing incomplete observations, and analyzing the resulting data are three indispensable phases of modern practice with public-use data files and with many other statistical applications.
		Each phase inherits different input, including the information preceding it and the intellectual assessments available, and aims to provide output that is one step closer to arriving at statistical inferences with scientific relevance. 
		However, the role of the imputation phase has often been viewed as merely providing computational convenience for users of data. Although facilitating computation is very important, such a viewpoint ignores the imputer's assessments and information inaccessible to the users. 
		This view underlies the recent controversy over the validity of multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be derived from (is ``uncongenial'' to) the model adopted for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are typically superior to, and thus different from, users' incomplete-data analyses. 
		The latter may suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such analyses often must rely on convenient but unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. 
		When it is desirable to conduct inferences under models for nonresponse other than the original imputation model, a possible alternative to recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate importance weights into the standard combining rules. 
		These points are reviewed and explored by simple examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, particularly from the randomization perspective. 
		Some convenient terms are suggested for facilitating communication among researchers from different perspectives when evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with uncongenial sources of input.

		Multiple imputation was designed to handle the problem of missing data in public-use data bases where the data-base constructor and the ultimate user are distinct entities. 
		The objective is valid frequency inference for ultimate users who in general have access only to complete-data software and possess limited knowledge of specific reasons and models for nonresponse. 
		For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. 
		This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. 
		These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results. 
		Then, criticisms of multiple imputation are considered, and, finally, comparisons are made to alternative strategies.

		Multiple imputation is a technique for handling data sets with missing values. The method fills in the missing values several times, creating several completed data sets for analysis. 
		Each data set is analyzed separately using techniques designed for complete data, and the results are then combined in such a way that the variability due to imputation may be incorporated. 
		Methods of imputing the missing values can vary from fully parametric to nonparametric. 
		In this paper, we compare partially parametric and fully parametric regression-based multiple-imputation methods. 
		The fully parametric method that we consider imputes missing regression outcomes by drawing them from their predictive distribution under the regression model, whereas the partially parametric methods are based on imputing outcomes or residuals for incomplete cases using values drawn from the complete cases. 
		For the partially parametric methods, we suggest a new approach to choosing complete cases from which to draw values. 
		In a Monte Carlo study in the regression setting, we investigate the robustness of the multiple-imputation schemes to misspecification of the underlying model for the data. 
		Sources of model misspecification considered include incorrect modeling of the mean structure as well as incorrect specification of the error distribution with regard to heaviness of the tails and heteroscedasticity. 
		The methods are compared with respect to the bias and efficiency of point estimates and the coverage rates of confidence intervals for the marginal mean and distribution function of the outcome. 
		We find that when the mean structure is specified correctly, all of the methods perform well, even if the error distribution is misspecified. 
		The fully parametric approach, however, produces slightly more efficient estimates of the marginal distribution function of the outcome than do the partially parametric approaches. 
		When the mean structure is misspecified, all of the methods still perform well for estimating the marginal mean, although the fully parametric method shows slight increases in bias and variance. 
		For estimating the marginal distribution function, however, the fully parametric method breaks down in several situations, whereas the partially parametric methods maintain their good performance. 
		In an application to AIDS research in a setting that is similar to although slightly more complicated than that of the Monte Carlo study, we examine how estimates for the distribution of the time from infection with HIV to the onset of AIDS vary with the method used to impute the residual time to AIDS for subjects with right-censored data. 
		The fully parametric and partially parametric techniques produce similar results, suggesting that the model selection used for fully parametric imputation was adequate. 
		Our application provides an example of how multiple imputation can be used to combine information from two cohorts to estimate quantities that cannot be estimated directly from either one of the cohorts separately.

		Analyses of multivariate data are frequently hampered by missing values. 
		Until recently, the only missing-data methods available to most data analysts have been relatively ad1 hoc practices such as listwise deletion. 
		Recent dramatic advances in theoretical and computational statistics, however, have produced anew generation of flexible procedures with a sound statistical basis. 
		These procedures involve multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), a simulation technique that replaces each missing datum with a set of m > 1 plausible values. 
		The m versions of the complete data are analyzed by standard complete-data methods, and the results are combined using simple rules to yield estimates, standard errors, and p-values that formally incorporate missing-data uncertainty. 
		New computational algorithms and software described in a recent book (Schafer, 1997a) allow us to create proper multiple imputations in complex multivariate settings. 
		This article reviews the key ideas of multiple imputation, discusses the software programs currently available, and demonstrates their use on data from the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial (Hansen \& Graham, 1991).

		We propose a remedy for the discrepancy between the way political scientists analyze data with missing values and the recommendations of the statistics community. 
		Methodologists and statisticians agree that ``multiple imputation'' is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one's explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis.
		The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise.
		We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data.
		This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature.
		We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples.
		Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.

		This article describes and evaluates a procedure for imputing missing values for a relatively complex data structure when the data are missing at random. 
		The imputations are obtained by fitting a sequence of regression models and drawing values from the corresponding predictive distributions. 
		The types of regression models used are linear, logistic, Poisson, generalized logit or a mixture of these depending on the type of variable being imputed. 
		Two additional common features in the imputation process are incorporated: restriction to a relevant subpopulation for some variables and logical bounds or constraints for the imputed values. 
		The restrictions involve subsetting the sample individuals that satisfy certain criteria while fitting the regression models. 
		The bounds involve drawing values from a truncated predictive distribution. 
		The development of this method was partly motivated by the analysis of two data sets which are used as illustrations. 
		The sequential regression procedure is applied to perform multiple imputation analysis for the two applied problems. 
		The sampling properties of inferences from multiply imputed data sets created using the sequential regression method are
		evaluated through simulated data sets.

		This article provides a comprehensive review of multiple imputation (MI), a technique for analyzing data sets with missing values. 
		Formally, MI is the process of replacing each missing data point with a set of m > 1 plausible values to generate m complete data sets. 
		These complete data sets are then analyzed by standard statistical software, and the results combined, to give parameter estimates and standard errors that take into account the uncertainty due to the missing data values. 
		This article introduces the idea behind MI, discusses the advantages of MI over existing techniques for addressing missing data, describes how to do MI for real problems, reviews the software available to implement MI, and discusses the results of a simulation study aimed at finding out how assumptions regarding the imputation model affect the parameter estimates provided by MI.

		Following the seminal publications of Rubin about thirty years ago, statisticians have become increasingly aware of the inadequacy of ``complete-case'' analysis of datasets with missing observations. 
		In medicine, for example, observations may be missing in a sporadic way for different covariates, and a complete-case analysis may omit as many as half of the available cases. Hotdeck imputation was implemented in Stata in 1999 by Mander and Clayton. 
		However, this technique may perform poorly when many rows of data have at least one missing value. 
		This article describes an implementation for Stata of the MICE method of multiple multivariate imputation described by van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook (1999). 
		MICE stands for multivariate imputation by chained equations. 
		The basic idea of data analysis with multiple imputation is to create a small number (e.g., 5-10) of copies of the data, each of which has the missing values suitably imputed, and analyze each complete dataset independently. 
		Estimates of parameters of interest are averaged across the copies to give a single estimate. 
		Standard errors are computed according to the ``Rubin rules'', devised to allow for the between- and within-imputation components of variation in the parameter estimates. 
		This article describes five ado-files. 
		mvis creates multiple multivariate imputations. 
		uvis imputes missing values for a single variable as a function of several covariates, each with complete data. micombine fits a wide variety of regression models to a multiply imputed dataset, combining the estimates using Rubin's rules, and supports survival analysis models (stcox and streg), categorical data models, generalized linear models, and more. 
		Finally, misplit and mijoin are utilities to intercon-vert datasets created by mvis and by the miset program from John Carlin and colleagues. 
		The use of the routines is illustrated with an example of prognostic modeling in breast cancer.

		The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. 
		The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. 
		This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. 
		Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models.
		The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. 
		Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from
		observed marginal distributions. 
		It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.

		Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. 
		In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. 
		However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. 
		MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information ($\gamma$) for the parameter being estimated, and m. 
		In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which $\gamma$ and m were varied. 
		Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. 
		Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. 
		Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. 
		These recommendations are based on $\gamma$, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.

		Missing data is a common complication in data analysis. 
		In many medical settings missing data can cause difficulties in estimation, precision and inference. 
		Multiple imputation (MI) (Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys. Wiley: New York, 1987) is a simulation-based approach to deal with incomplete data. 
		Although there are many different methods to deal with incomplete data, MI has become one of the leading methods. 
		Since the late 1980s we observed a constant increase in the use and publication of MI-related research. 
		This tutorial does not attempt to cover all the material concerning MI, but rather provides an overview and combines together the theory behind MI, the implementation of MI, and discusses increasing possibilities of the use of MI using commercial and free software. 
		We illustrate some of the major points using an example from an Alzheimer disease (AD) study. 
		In this AD study, while clinical data are available for all subjects, postmortem data are only available for the subset of those who died and underwent an autopsy. 
		Analysis of incomplete data requires making unverifiable assumptions.
		These assumptions are discussed in detail in the text. 
		Relevant S-Plus code is provided.

		This paper provides an overview of multiple imputation and current perspectives on its use in medical research. 
		We begin with a brief review of the problem of handling missing data in general and place multiple imputation in this context, emphasizing its relevance for longitudinal clinical trials and observational studies with missing covariates. 
		We outline how multiple imputation proceeds in practice and then sketch its rationale. 
		We explore the problem of obtaining proper imputations in some detail and distinguish two main classes of approach, methods based on fully multivariate models, and those that iterate conditional univariate models. 
		We show how the use of so-called uncongenial imputation models are particularly valuable for sensitivity analyses and also for certain analyses in clinical trial settings. 
		We also touch upon other forms of sensitivity analysis that use multiple imputation. 
		Finally, we give some open questions that the increasing use of multiple imputation has thrown up, which we believe are useful directions for future research.

		Multiple imputation has become viewed as a general solution to missing data problems in statistics. 
		However, in order to lead to consistent asymptotically normal estimators, correct variance estimators and valid tests, the imputations must be proper. 
		So far it seems that only Bayesian multiple imputation, i.e. using a Bayesian predictive distribution to generate the imputations, or approximately Bayesian multiple imputations has been shown to lead to proper imputations in some settings. 
		In this paper, we shall see that Bayesian multiple imputation does not generally lead to proper multiple imputations. 
		Furthermore, it will be argued that for general statistical use, Bayesian multiple imputation is inefficient even when it is proper.

		Multiple imputation was first conceived as a tool that statistical agencies could use to handle nonresponse in large-sample public use surveys. 
		In the last two decades, the multiple-imputation framework has been adapted for other statistical contexts. 
		For example, individual researchers use multiple imputation to handle missing data in small samples, statistical agencies disseminate multiply-imputed data sets for purposes of protecting data confidentiality, and survey methodologists and epidemiologists use multiple imputation to correct for measurement errors. 
		In some of these settings, Rubin's original rules for combining the point and variance estimates from the multiply-imputed data sets are not appropriate, because what is known--and thus the conditional expectations and variances used to derive inferential methods--differs from that in the missing-data context. 
		These applications require new combining rules and methods of inference.
		In fact, more than 10 combining rules exist in the published literature.
		This article describes some of the main adaptations of the multiple-imputation framework, including missing data in large and small samples, data confidentiality, and measurement error. 
		It reviews the combining rules for each setting and explains why they differ. 
		Finally, it highlights research topics in extending the multiple-imputation framework.

		Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) has emerged as a principled method of dealing with missing data. 
		Despite properties that make MICE particularly useful for large imputation procedures and advances in software development that now make it accessible to many researchers, many psychiatric researchers have not been trained in these methods and few practical resources exist to guide researchers in the implementation of this technique. 
		This paper provides an introduction to the MICE method with a focus on practical aspects and challenges in using this method. 
		A brief review of software programs available to implement MICE and then analyze multiply imputed data is also provided.

		We consider the relative performance of two common approaches to multiple imputation (MI): joint multivariate normal (MVN) MI, in which the data are modeled as a sample from a joint MVN distribution; and conditional MI, in which each variable is modeled conditionally on all the others. 
		In order to use the multivariate normal distribution, implementations of joint MVN MI typically assume that categories of discrete variables are probabilistically constructed from continuous values. 
		We use simulations to examine the implications of these assumptions. For each approach, we assess (1) the accuracy of the imputed values; and (2) the accuracy of coefficients and fitted values from a model fit to completed data sets. 
		These simulations consider continuous, binary, ordinal, and unordered-categorical variables. One set of simulations uses multivariate normal data, and one set uses data from the 2008 American National Election Studies.
		We implement a less restrictive approach than is typical when evaluating methods using simulations in the missing data literature: in each case, missing values are generated by carefully following the conditions necessary for missingness to be ``missing at random'' (MAR). 
		We find that in these situations conditional MI is more accurate than joint MVN MI whenever the data include categorical variables.

		Political scientists increasingly recognize that multiple imputation represents a superior strategy for analyzing missing data to the widely used method of listwise deletion. 
		However, there has been little systematic investigation of how multiple imputation affects existing empirical knowledge in the discipline. 
		This article presents the first large-scale examination of the empirical effects of substituting multiple imputation for listwise deletion in political science. 
		The examination focuses on research in the major subfield of comparative and international political economy (CIPE) as an illustrative example.
		Specifically, I use multiple imputation to reanalyze the results of almost every quantitative CIPE study published during a recent five-year period in International Organization and World Politics, two of the leading subfield journals in CIPE. 
		The outcome is striking: in almost half of the studies, key results ``disappear'' (by conventional statistical standards) when reanalyzed.

		Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) has emerged as a popular approach for handling missing data. 
		A central challenge for applying MICE is determining how to incorporate outcome information into covariate imputation models, particularly for complicated outcomes. 
		Often, we have a particular analysis model in mind, and we would like to ensure congeniality between the imputation and analysis models. 
		We propose a novel strategy for directly incorporating the analysis model into the handling of missing data. 
		In our proposed approach, multiple imputations of missing covariates are obtained without using outcome information. 
		We then utilize the strategy of imputation stacking, where multiple imputations are stacked on top of each other to create a large data set.
		The analysis model is then incorporated through weights. 
		Instead of applying Rubin's combining rules, we obtain parameter estimates by fitting a weighted version of the analysis model on the stacked data set. 
		We propose a novel estimator for obtaining standard errors for this stacked and weighted analysis. 
		Our estimator is based on the observed data information principle in Louis' work and can be applied for analyzing stacked multiple imputations more generally. 
		Our approach for analyzing stacked multiple imputations is the first method that can be easily applied (using R package StackImpute) for a wide variety of standard analysis models and missing data settings.
