		Mediation models are widely used, 
		and there are many tests of the mediated effect. 
		One of the most common questions that researchers have when planning mediation studies is, 
		``How many subjects do I need to achieve adequate power when testing for mediation?'' 
		This article presents the necessary sample sizes for six of the most common and the most recommended tests of mediation for various combinations of parameters, 
		to provide a guide for researchers when designing studies or applying for grants.

		Increasing the correlation between the independent variable and the mediator ($a$ coefficient) increases the effect size ($ab$) for mediation analysis;
		however,
		increasing a by definition increases collinearity in mediation models.
		As a result,
		the standard error of product tests increase.
		The variance inflation caused by increases in a at some point outweighs the increase of the effect size ($ab$) and results in a loss of statistical power.
		This phenomenon also occurs with nonparametric bootstrapping approaches because the variance of the bootstrap distribution of $ab$ approximates the variance expected from normal theory. 
		Both variances increase dramatically when a exceeds the $b$ coefficient,
		thus explaining the power decline with increases in $a$.
		Implications for statistical analysis and applied researchers are discussed.

		Two rather surprising anomalies relating to statistical power occur in testing mediation.
		First,
		in a model with no direct effect for which the total effect and indirect effect are identical,
		the power for the test of the total effect can be dramatically smaller than the power for the test of the indirect effect.
		Second,
		when there is a direct effect of a causal variable on the outcome controlling for the mediator,
		the power of the test of the indirect effect is often considerably greater than the power of the test of the direct effect,
		even when the two are of the same magnitude.
		We try to explain the reasons for these anomalies and how they affect practice.
