		This article presents the rationale and procedures for conducting a process analysis in evaluation research. 
		Such an analysis attempts to identify the process that mediates the effects of some treatment, 
		by estimating the parameters of a causal chain between the treatment and some outcome variable. 
		Two different procedures for estimating mediation are discussed. 
		In addition we present procedures for examining whether a treatment exerts its effects, 
		in part, 
		by altering the mediating process that produces the outcome. 
		Finally, the benefits of process analysis in evaluation research are underlined.

		Discusses mediation relations in causal terms. 
		Influences of an antecedent are transmitted to a consequence through an intervening mediator. 
		Mediation relations may assume a number of functional forms, 
		including nonadditive, 
		nonlinear, 
		and nonrecursive forms. 
		Although mediation and moderation are distinguishable processes, 
		with nonadditive forms (moderated mediation) a particular variable may be both a mediator and a moderator within a single set of functional relations. 
		Current models for testing mediation relations in industrial and organizational psychology often involve an interplay between exploratory (correlational) statistical tests and causal inference. 
		It is suggested that no middle ground exists between exploratory and confirmatory (causal) analysis and that attempts to explain how mediation processes occur require specified causal models.

		In this article, 
		we attempt to distinguish between the properties of moderator and mediator variables at a number of levels. 
		First, 
		we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, 
		both conceptually and strategically, 
		the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. 
		We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, 
		including control and stress, 
		attitudes, 
		and personality traits. 
		We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, 
		both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.
