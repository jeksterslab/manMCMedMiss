		This volume introduces the statistical, 
		methodological, 
		and conceptual aspects of mediation analysis. 
		Applications from health, 
		social, 
		and developmental psychology, 
		sociology, 
		communication, 
		exercise science, 
		and epidemiology are emphasized throughout. 
		Single-mediator, 
		multilevel, 
		and longitudinal models are reviewed. 
		The author's goal is to help the reader apply mediation analysis to their own data and understand its limitations.
						
		Each chapter features an overview, 
		numerous worked examples, 
		a summary,
		and exercises (with answers to the odd numbered questions). 
		The accompanying downloadable resources contain outputs described in the book from SAS, 
		SPSS, 
		LISREL, 
		EQS, 
		MPLUS, 
		and CALIS, 
		and a program to simulate the model. 
		The notation used is consistent with existing literature on mediation in psychology.
						
		The book opens with a review of the types of research questions the mediation model addresses. 
		Part II describes the estimation of mediation effects including assumptions, 
		statistical tests, 
		and the construction of confidence limits. 
		Advanced models including mediation in path analysis, 
		longitudinal models, 
		multilevel data, 
		categorical variables, 
		and mediation in the context of moderation are then described. 
		The book closes with a discussion of the limits of mediation analysis, 
		additional approaches to identifying mediating variables, 
		and future directions.
						
		Introduction to Statistical Mediation Analysis is intended for researchers and advanced students in health, 
		social, 
		clinical, 
		and developmental psychology as well as communication, 
		public health, 
		nursing, 
		epidemiology, 
		and sociology. 
		Some exposure to a graduate level research methods or statistics course is assumed. 
		The overview of mediation analysis and the guidelines for conducting a mediation analysis will be appreciated by all readers.

		Written in a friendly, 
		conversational style, 
		this book offers a hands-on approach to statistical mediation and moderation for both beginning researchers and those familiar with modeling. 
		Starting with a gentle review of regression-based analysis,
		Paul Jose covers basic mediation and moderation techniques before moving on to advanced topics in multilevel modeling, 
		structural equation modeling, 
		and hybrid combinations, 
		such as moderated mediation. 
		User-friendly features include numerous graphs and carefully worked-through examples; 
		``Helpful Suggestions'' about procedures and pitfalls; 
		``Knowledge Boxes'' delving into special topics, 
		such as dummy coding; 
		and end-of-chapter exercises and problems (with answers). 
		The companion website provides downloadable sample data sets that are used in the book to demonstrate particular analytic strategies, 
		and explains how researchers and students can execute analyses using Jose's online programs, 
		MedGraph and ModGraph. 
		Appendices present SPSS, 
		AMOS, 
		and Mplus syntax for conducting the key types of analyses.

		Lauded for its easy-to-understand,
		conversational discussion of the fundamentals of mediation, 
		moderation, 
		and conditional process analysis, 
		this book has been fully revised with 50\% new content,
		including sections on working with multicategorical antecedent variables, 
		the use of PROCESS version 3 for SPSS and SAS for model estimation, 
		and annotated PROCESS v3 outputs. 
		Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, 
		Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, 
		as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. 
		Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, 
		indirect, 
		and conditional effects; 
		probe and visualize interactions; 
		test questions about moderated mediation; 
		and report different types of analyses. 
		Data for all the examples are available on the companion website (www.afhayes.com)
		along with links to download PROCESS.
