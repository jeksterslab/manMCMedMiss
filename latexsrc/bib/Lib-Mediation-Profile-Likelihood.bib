		Mediators are variables that explain the association between an independent variable and a dependent variable. 
		Structural equation modeling (SEM) is widely used to test models with mediating effects. 
		This article illustrates how to construct confidence intervals (CIs) of the mediating effects for a variety of models in SEM. 
		Specifically, mediating models with 1 mediator, 2 intermediate mediators, 2 specific mediators, and 1 mediator in 2 independent groups are illustrated. 
		By using phantom variables (Rindskopf, 1984), 
		a Wald CI, 
		percentile bootstrap CI, 
		bias-corrected bootstrap CI, 
		and a likelihood-based CI on the mediating effect are easily constructed with some existing SEM packages, 
		such as LISREL, Mplus, and Mx. 
		Monte Carlo simulation studies are used to compare the coverage probabilities of these CIs. 
		The results show that the coverage probabilities of these CIs are comparable when the mediating effect is large or when the sample size is large. 
		However, when the mediating effect and the sample size are both small, the bootstrap CI and likelihood-based CI are preferred over the Wald CI. 
		Extensions of this SEM approach for future research are discussed.

		Mediation models are often used as a means to explain the psychological mechanisms between an independent and a dependent variable in the behavioral and social sciences. 
		A major limitation of the unstandardized indirect effect calculated from raw scores is that it cannot be interpreted as an effect-size measure. 
		In contrast, the standardized indirect effect calculated from standardized scores can be a good candidate as a measure of effect size because it is scale invariant. 
		In the present article, 11 methods for constructing the confidence intervals (CIs) of the standardized indirect effects were evaluated via a computer simulation. 
		These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI. 
		The results consistently showed that the percentile bootstrap, the bias-corrected bootstrap, and the likelihood-based approaches had the best coverage probability. 
		Mplus, LISREL, and Mx syntax were included to facilitate the use of these preferred methods in applied settings. Future issues on the use of the standardized indirect effects are discussed.

Confidence intervals (CIs) for parameters are usually constructed based on the estimated standard errors. 
These are known as Wald CIs. 
This article argues that likelihood-based CIs (CIs based on likelihood ratio statistics) are often preferred to Wald CIs. 
It shows how the likelihood-based CIs and the Wald CIs for many statistics and psychometric indexes can be constructed with the use of phantom variables (Rindskopf, 1984) in some of the current structural equation modeling (SEM) packages. 
The procedures to form CIs for the differences in correlation coefficients, squared multiple correlations, indirect effects, coefficient alphas, and reliability estimates are illustrated. 
A simulation study on the Pearson correlation is used to demonstrate the advantages of the likelihood-based CI over the Wald CI. 
Issues arising from this SEM approach and extensions of this approach are discussed.

		A SEM-based approach using likelihood-based confidence interval (LBCI) has been proposed to form confidence intervals for unstandardized and standardized indirect effect in mediation models.
		However,
		when used with the maximum likelihood estimation,
		this approach requires that the variables are multivariate normally distributed.
		This can affect the LBCIs of unstandardized and standardized effect differently.
		In the present study,
		the robustness of this approach when the predictor is not normally distributed but the error terms are conditionally normal,
		which does not violate the distributional assumption of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation,
		is compared to four other approaches:
		nonparametric bootstrapping,
		two variants of LBCI,
		LBCI assuming the predictor is fixed (LBCI-Fixed-X) and LBCI based on ADF estimation (LBCI-ADF),
		and Monte Carlo.
		A simulation study was conducted using a simple mediation model and a serial mediation model,
		manipulating the distribution of the predictor.
		The Monte Carlo method performed worst among the methods.
		LBCI and LBCI-Fixed-X had suboptimal performance when the distributions had high kurtosis and the population indirect effects were medium to large.
		In some conditions,
		the problem was severe even when the sample size was large.
		LBCI-ADF and nonparametric bootstrapping had coverage probabilities close to the nominal value in nearly all conditions,
		although the coverage probabilities were still suboptimal for the serial mediation model when the sample size was small with respect to the model.
		Implications of these findings in the context of this special case of nonnormal data were discussed.
