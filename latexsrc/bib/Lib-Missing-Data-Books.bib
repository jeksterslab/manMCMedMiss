		Demonstrates how nonresponse in sample surveys and censuses can be handled by replacing each missing value with two or more multiple imputations. 
		Clearly illustrates the advantages of modern computing to such handle surveys, 
		and demonstrates the benefit of this statistical technique for researchers who must analyze them. 
		Also presents the background for Bayesian and frequentist theory. 
		After establishing that only standard complete-data methods are needed to analyze a multiply-imputed set, 
		the text evaluates procedures in general circumstances, 
		outlining specific procedures for creating imputations in both the ignorable and nonignorable cases. 
		Examples and exercises reinforce ideas, 
		and the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas presents a unified picture of modern statistics.

		The last two decades have seen enormous developments in statistical methods for incomplete data. 
		The EM algorithm and its extensions, 
		multiple imputation, 
		and Markov Chain Monte Carlo provide a set of flexible and reliable tools from inference in large classes of missing-data problems. 
		Yet, 
		in practical terms, 
		those developments have had surprisingly little impact on the way most data analysts handle missing values on a routine basis.
				
		Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, 
		making these missing-data tools accessible to a broad audience. 
		It presents a unified, 
		Bayesian approach to the analysis of incomplete multivariate data, 
		covering datasets in which the variables are continuous, 
		categorical, 
		or both. 
		The focus is applied, 
		where necessary, 
		to help readers thoroughly understand the statistical properties of those methods, 
		and the behavior of the accompanying algorithms.
				
		All techniques are illustrated with real data examples, 
		with extended discussion and practical advice. 
		All of the algorithms described in this book have been implemented by the author for general use in the statistical languages S and S Plus. 
		The software is available free of charge on the Internet.

		Sooner or later anyone who does statistical analysis runs into problems with missing data in which information for some variables is missing for some cases. 
		Why is this a problem? Because most statistical methods presume that every case has information on all the variables to be included in the analysis. 
		Using numerous examples and practical tips, 
		this book offers a non-technical explanation of the standard methods for missing data (such as listwise or casewise deletion) as well as two newer (and, better) methods, 
		maximum likelihood and multiple imputation. 
		Anyone who has been relying on ad-hoc methods that are statistically inefficient or biased will find this book a welcome and accessible solution to their problems with handling missing data.

		and generalizability of a studyâ€™s conclusions. 
		They provide practical recommendations for designing studies that decrease the likelihood of missing data,

		Missing data affect nearly every discipline by complicating the statistical analysis of collected data. 
		But since the 1990s, 
		there have been important developments in the statistical methodology for handling missing data. 
		Written by renowned statisticians in this area, 
		Handbook of Missing Data Methodology presents many methodological advances and the latest applications of missing data methods in empirical research.
				
		Divided into six parts, 
		the handbook begins by establishing notation and terminology. 
		It reviews the general taxonomy of missing data mechanisms and their implications for analysis and offers a historical perspective on early methods for handling missing data. 
		The following three parts cover various inference paradigms when data are missing,
		including likelihood and Bayesian methods; 
		semi-parametric methods, 
		with particular emphasis on inverse probability weighting; 
		and multiple imputation methods.
				
		The next part of the book focuses on a range of approaches that assess the sensitivity of inferences to alternative, 
		routinely non-verifiable assumptions about the missing data process. 
		The final part discusses special topics, such as missing data in clinical trials and sample surveys as well as approaches to model diagnostics in the missing data setting. 
		In each part, 
		an introduction provides useful background material and an overview to set the stage for subsequent chapters.
				
		Covering both established and emerging methodologies for missing data, 
		this book sets the scene for future research. 
		It provides the framework for readers to delve into research and practical applications of missing data methods.

		Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. 
		Simple ad-hoc fixes, 
		like deletion or mean imputation, 
		only work under highly restrictive conditions, 
		which are often not met in practice. 
		Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. 
		The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. 
		Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, 
		and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. 
		Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.
				
		This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, 
		focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. 
		This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field.
				
		This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: 
		formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. 
		The book sharpens the readerâ€™s intuition on how to think about missing data, 
		and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.

		An up-to-date, comprehensive treatment of a classic text on missing data in statistics.
				
		The topic of missing data has gained considerable attention in recent decades. 
		This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. 
		Blending theory and application, 
		authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. 
		They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, 
		and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.
				
		Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 
		Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. 
		It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, 
		as well as a taxonomy of missing data. 
		It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, 
		before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, 
		including weighting methods. 
		The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, 
		causal inference, 
		diagnostic methods, 
		and sensitivity analysis, 
		among a host of other topics.
				
		\begin{itemize}
			\item An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject
			\item Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones)
			\item Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods
			\item Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience
			\item Contains an updated and expanded bibliography
		\end{itemize}
				
		The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, 
		for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, 
		methodology or applications. 
		Their work ``has been no less than defining and transforming.'' (ISI)
				
		Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 
		Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. 
		It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.
