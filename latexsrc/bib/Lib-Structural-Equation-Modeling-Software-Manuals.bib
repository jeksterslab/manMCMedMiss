		The new software package OpenMx 2.0 for structural equation and other statistical modeling is introduced and its features are described. 
		OpenMx is evolving in a modular direction and now allows a mix-and-match computational approach that separates model expectations from fit functions and optimizers. 
		Major backend architectural improvements include a move to swappable open-source optimizers such as the newly written CSOLNP. 
		Entire new methodologies such as item factor analysis and state space modeling have been implemented. 
		New model expectation functions including support for the expression of models in LISREL syntax and a simplified multigroup expectation function are available. 
		Ease-of-use improvements include helper functions to standardize model parameters and compute their Jacobian-based standard errors, access to model components through standard R \$ mechanisms, and improved tab completion from within the R Graphical User Interface.

		Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a vast field and widely used by many applied researchers in the social and behavioral sciences. 
		Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. 
		However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. 
		The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. 
		This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.
