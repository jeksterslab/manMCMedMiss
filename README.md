## Description

Research compendium for the manuscript Pesigan, I. J. A., & Cheung, S.
F. (In Press). Monte Carlo confidence intervals for the indirect effect
with missing data. *Behavior Research Methods*.

## Acknowledgment

The simulation was performed in part at the High-Performance Computing
Cluster (HPCC) which is supported by the Information and Communication
Technology Office (ICTO) of the University of Macau. See
<https://icto.um.edu.mo/teaching-learning-research/high-performance-computing-cluster-hpcc/>
for more information on the University of Macauâ€™s High-Performance
Computing Cluster (HPCC). We used the third-generation HPCC (Coral)
particularly the `serial-normal` and `serial-short` cluster partitions.
See `.sim/README.md` and the scripts in the `.sim` folder in the
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss) repository for
more details on how the simulation was performed.

## Installation

You can install `manMCMedMiss` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss")
```

for containerized versions of the package.

## Preprint

See
<https://github.com/jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss/blob/main/latexsrc/manMCMedMiss-manuscript.tex>
for the latex file of the preprint version of the manuscript. See
<https://github.com/jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss/blob/main/latexsrc/pdf/manMCMedMiss-manuscript.pdf>
for the compiled PDF.

## R Package

Monte Carlo confidence intervals for free and defined parameters in
models fitted in the structural equation modeling package `lavaan` can
be generated using the `semmcci` package. `semmcci` is available on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
(<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=semmcci>). Documentation and
examples can be found in the accompanying website
(<https://jeksterslab.github.io/semmcci>).

## More Information

See [GitHub
Pages](https://jeksterslab.github.io/manMCMedMiss/index.html) for
package documentation.
