## Description

Research compendium for the manuscript **Monte Carlo Confidence
Intervals for the Indirect Effect with Missing Data** containing scripts
used in the simulation study and other supplementary materials.

## Acknowledgment

The simulation was performed in part at the High-Performance Computing
Cluster (HPCC) which is supported by the Information and Communication
Technology Office (ICTO) of the University of Macau. See
<https://icto.um.edu.mo/teaching-learning-research/high-performance-computing-cluster-hpcc/>
for more information on the University of Macauâ€™s High-Performance
Computing Cluster (HPCC). We used the third-generation HPCC (Coral)
particularly the `serial-normal` and `serial-short` cluster partitions.
See `.sim/README.md` and the scripts in the `.sim` folder in the
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manMCMedMiss) repository for
more details on how the simulation was performed.
